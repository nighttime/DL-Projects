# Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of my DL projects.

I use Python 3 with Keras and a TensorFlow backend.

## Contents:
* __MNIST handwritten digit classification__
  * `feed_forward`: a 2-layer, feed-forward network architecture (achieves 97.34% accuracy)
  * `conv`: a convolutional network architecture
