# Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of my DL projects.

I use Python 3 with Keras and a TensorFlow backend.

Run any model like this:
`python MNIST-feed_forward.py`

## Contents:
* __MNIST handwritten digit classification__
  * `MNIST-feed_forward`: a 2-layer, feed-forward network architecture (achieves 97.34% accuracy)
  * `MNIST-conv`: a convolutional network architecture
  * `MNIST-maxout-ff`: a network of Maxout neurons arranged in a dense, feed forward architecture
* __ModelDetails: Full writeup for each model implemented here__
  * `README-MINST-feed_forward`
  * `README-MINST-conv`
