# Deep Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of my DL projects.

I use Python 3 with Keras and a TensorFlow backend.

## Contents:
* __MNIST digit classification__
  * `feed_forward`: this is a 2-layer, feed-forward network for handwritten digit classification (achieves 97.04% accuracy)
